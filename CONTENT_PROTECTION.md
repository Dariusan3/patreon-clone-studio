# Content Protection System Documentation

This document describes the secure content protection system implemented for this membership platform.

## Overview

The content protection system ensures that locked posts and files are only accessible to users with appropriate membership tiers through server-side verification and token-based access.

## Security Features

### 1. **Server-Side Verification**
- All content access is verified through backend edge functions
- No sensitive content URLs are exposed to the client
- Authentication checked before serving any protected content

### 2. **Token-Based File Access**
- Signed URLs with time-limited expiration (1 hour)
- URLs generated only after membership verification
- Cannot be shared or reused after expiration

### 3. **Protected Content Display**
- Locked content is blurred with CSS
- Text content uses `select-none` and `pointer-events-none` to prevent selection
- Lock overlays provide clear membership prompts

### 4. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**
- Database policies enforce access control at the database level
- Public users can only view published, non-locked posts
- Authenticated users must own content or have proper membership tier

## Architecture

### Database Tables

#### `posts`
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- user_id: UUID (creator)
- title: TEXT
- content: TEXT
- category: TEXT
- is_locked: BOOLEAN
- required_tier: TEXT (membership tier needed)
- is_featured: BOOLEAN
- featured_order: INTEGER
- is_published: BOOLEAN
```

#### `post_files`
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- post_id: UUID (foreign key to posts)
- file_name: TEXT
- file_type: TEXT
- file_path: TEXT (storage path)
- file_size: INTEGER
- is_downloadable: BOOLEAN
```

### Storage Bucket

**`post-content`**
- Private bucket (public = false)
- Max file size: 10MB
- Allowed types: images, videos, PDFs, ZIP files
- Access controlled via RLS policies

### Edge Functions

#### `generate-signed-url`
**Purpose**: Generate time-limited signed URLs for file access

**Flow**:
1. Verify user authentication
2. Check post ownership or membership tier
3. Generate signed URL (1 hour expiration)
4. Return URL to client

**Security**:
- Requires valid JWT token
- Verifies post access before generating URL
- Logs all access attempts

#### `verify-content-access`
**Purpose**: Verify user access to locked content

**Flow**:
1. Check if content is locked
2. If locked, verify authentication
3. Check ownership or membership tier
4. Return access status and reason

**Response**:
```typescript
{
  hasAccess: boolean,
  reason: 'public' | 'owner' | 'membership_valid' | 'authentication_required' | 'insufficient_tier',
  requiredTier?: string,
  post?: object
}
```

## Frontend Components

### `useContentProtection` Hook
Manages content access verification state
```typescript
const { accessStatus, loading, error } = useContentProtection(postId)
```

### `useSignedUrl` Hook
Handles signed URL generation for secure file access
```typescript
const { getSignedUrl, loading } = useSignedUrl()
const url = await getSignedUrl(postId, filePath)
```

### `SecureImage` Component
Displays images with protection overlay for locked content
```tsx
<SecureImage
  postId={post.id}
  filePath={post.imagePath}
  alt="Post image"
  isLocked={post.isLocked}
/>
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

✅ **No Direct Storage URLs**: Never expose direct storage URLs to client
✅ **Server-Side Validation**: All access checks happen on the backend
✅ **Time-Limited Access**: Signed URLs expire after 1 hour
✅ **Database-Level Security**: RLS policies as defense-in-depth
✅ **Content Obfuscation**: Locked content blurred and non-selectable
✅ **Audit Logging**: All access attempts logged for monitoring

## Implementation Checklist

### Membership Tier System (TODO)
Currently, the system has placeholders for membership verification. To complete the implementation:

1. Create `user_memberships` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_memberships (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  tier TEXT NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);
```

2. Update edge functions to check actual membership:
```typescript
const { data: membership } = await supabaseClient
  .from('user_memberships')
  .select('tier')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single()

const hasAccess = checkTierAccess(membership.tier, post.required_tier)
```

3. Implement tier hierarchy (e.g., "Free" < "Supporter" < "Art Enthusiast")

### Storage Security (TODO)
For production, consider:
- Implementing file scanning for uploads
- Adding watermarks to protected images
- Rate limiting signed URL generation
- Monitoring for suspicious access patterns

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. ✅ Unauthenticated user cannot access locked content
2. ✅ Authenticated user without tier cannot access locked content
3. ✅ Post owner can always access their content
4. ✅ User with correct tier can access locked content
5. ✅ Signed URLs expire after time limit
6. ✅ Direct storage URLs are blocked by RLS

## Monitoring

Monitor these edge function logs:
- Authentication failures
- Access denied events
- Signed URL generation requests
- Post access patterns

Access logs in the backend dashboard under Functions > Logs.
